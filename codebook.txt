File produced by run_analysis.R is a modification of Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0

This file contains average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

------------------------------------
How the file was reate.

To create the file following chanes and operationswa done using files from oryginal data set and its codebook files:

Data from test/X_test.txt and train/X_train.txt were fitered to contain only columns concearning means. features_info.txt file was used to determine which columns contain mean values.

After filtering Activity Labels were added to test and train filtered data using train/y_test.txt and train/y_test.txt files.  These data were added as the first column. Thereafter Subject ID data were aded , again as first column using test/subject_test.txt and train/subject_train.txt.

Those new sets of test and train data were merged into one file.

Names were aded to this new data set. First two collumn were named: Activity_Label, Subject_ID. Rest of the columns were named based on names in features.txt (only names for mean values selcted as described above). The names were changed using following rules: all dash characters were changed to underscore, all parenthesis were removed, all spaes were removed (tBodyAcc-mean()-X becomes tBodyAcc_mean_Y)

Base on this file new tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject was created.

------------------------------------
